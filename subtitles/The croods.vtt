>> GRUG: Tonight we will hear the story of Crispy Bear.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.649
A long time ago,
this little bear was alive

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:20.500
because she listened to her father.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.500
So she was happy.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.930
But Crispy had one terrible problem.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.850
She was filled with

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.420
curiosity.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.210
Yes! And one day

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.310
she saw something new and died!

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.555
>> THUNK: Just like that?
>> GRUG: Yes!

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.180
>> GRAN: Same ending as everyday.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.500
>> THUNK: I get it dad, I will never do anything new or different.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:43.990
>> GRUG: Good man, Thunk

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.890
>> EEP: Ughhh

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:56.390
[music]

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.970
>> EEP: My family has always survived by

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.170
>> living by my dad's one rule:

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.900
Never leave the cave.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.790
>> EEP: We never had a

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.860
>> chance to explore the outside world.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.560
>> EEP: But what we didn't know was that

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.760
>> our world

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.000
>> was about to change.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.970
>> GRUG: EEP!

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.070
>> GRUG: COME DOWN!

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.979
>> GRUG: Into the cave!

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:28.920
>> GRUG: GO!

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:34.920
[yelling and rocks falling]

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.230
>> GRUG: LOOK OUT!

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.500
>> EEP: You really need to see this.
