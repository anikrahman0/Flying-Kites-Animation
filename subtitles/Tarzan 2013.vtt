1
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.724
The amazing story I am about to tell you

2
00:00:32.798 --> 00:00:36.134
took place in the deepest and
darkest parts of Africa.

3
00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:39.170
It is the tale of a
young boy from New York

4
00:00:39.171 --> 00:00:42.473
who lost everything to
become the king of the jungle.

5
00:00:51.017 --> 00:00:53.000
But let's start at the beginning.

6
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.089
To be precise, 70 million years earlier.

7
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.150
When the great dinosaurs ruled the earth.

8
00:01:34.184 --> 00:01:36.184
Tarzan.

9
00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:40.997
An American named Greystoke set
up camp at the edge of the jungle.

10
00:01:41.068 --> 00:01:43.235
He spent weeks in search of the meteor

11
00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:45.227
while his family enjoyed the wilderness.

12
00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:48.206
See, Gigira? I told you he'd be back.

13
00:01:51.178 --> 00:01:55.171
J.J.? J.J., where are you?

14
00:01:57.284 --> 00:02:00.000
- Yeah, mom.
- Come on, that's enough fun.

15
00:02:00.354 --> 00:02:02.146
It's time to eat. Come on, J.J.

16
00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:05.192
JJ? Who's JJ? My name is Tarzan!

17
00:02:05.393 --> 00:02:07.259
Gigira gave me the name.

18
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.196
It's ape language. It
means 'Ape with no fur'.

19
00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:14.224
Oh, that makes sense, little monkey.

20
00:02:15.436 --> 00:02:18.405
Hey, guys, wait for Tarzan!

21
00:02:21.947 --> 00:02:27.448
Greystoke was financing the expedition,
and he had become pretty impatient.

22
00:02:27.953 --> 00:02:31.119
Nothing - there's nothing here.

23
00:02:31.155 --> 00:02:34.122
Wow. That wall of fog again.

24
00:02:34.155 --> 00:02:35.693
My instruments are going haywire!

25
00:02:35.703 --> 00:02:38.329
Okay, that's it. Expedition's over.

26
00:02:38.964 --> 00:02:41.533
There's absolutely no sign of
your mysterious meteor here, Porter.

27
00:02:42.634 --> 00:02:44.235
Great! Just great.

28
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.410
They would probably never find this meteor

29
00:02:53.612 --> 00:02:58.000
which, according to ancient folklore,
possesses limitless power.


30
00:02:58.114 --> 00:03:00.000
And is guarded by wild monkeys.

31
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.000
And who knows what other amazing secrets

32
00:03:03.798 --> 00:03:07.000
may lay deep within that mysterious rock.

33
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
The power of the meteor is
supposed to be beyond imagination!

34
00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.562
John, we have to continue our search.
Jim, wake up!

35
00:03:21.655 --> 00:03:23.674
It's just a local legend.

36
00:03:23.675 --> 00:03:26.511
We've searched every
square inch of this place.

37
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.671
And the reports of the
19th century explorers?

38
00:03:28.673 --> 00:03:31.648
Are the romantic fantasies
of treasure hunters.

39
00:03:32.784 --> 00:03:34.785
And this?

40
00:03:34.786 --> 00:03:38.755
A lump of metal from a flea market
in Kagali isn't proof.

41
00:03:38.757 --> 00:03:40.850
A word of advice between friends...

42
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.895
Take down your tent and come
back to New York with us.

43
00:03:43.896 --> 00:03:45.697
You've got a beautiful wife waiting there,

44
00:03:45.698 --> 00:03:49.896
and a lovely daughter,
and they are real, Porter.

45
00:03:49.897 --> 00:03:53.869
If this meteor really
exists, it's Not here.

46
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.235
Listen!

47
00:03:57.308 --> 00:03:58.776
I'm Tarzan!

48
00:03:58.986 --> 00:04:03.275
When I come back, I'm gonna
be king of the jungle!

49
00:04:04.715 --> 00:04:05.715
Tarzan?

50
00:04:06.117 --> 00:04:08.275
Uh-huh. He made it up.

51
00:04:08.352 --> 00:04:10.583
Your son's got quite the
imagination, you know that?

52
00:04:10.656 --> 00:04:13.523
It must get that from your end of the gene pool.

53
00:04:13.592 --> 00:04:14.832
Incorrigible dreamer, huh?

54
00:04:15.093 --> 00:04:17.795
Is there any other reason why you
dragged us to the end of the world?

55
00:04:18.796 --> 00:04:20.896
Mommy, daddy! Look at me!

56
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.950
JJ, What...?

57
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.500
<i>Monkeys Laughing</i>

58
00:04:28.773 --> 00:04:29.813
You sure you want to stay?

59
00:04:29.874 --> 00:04:32.708
You still don't get it?
The jungle's my life.

60
00:04:32.989 --> 00:04:34.778
You take care.

61
00:04:37.716 --> 00:04:39.650
Kiss Jane for me!

62
00:04:47.926 --> 00:04:50.895
John! Look! Down there!

63
00:04:51.964 --> 00:04:55.900
A loner. A mountain gorilla,
looking for a new family.

64
00:04:55.968 --> 00:04:57.869
Very, very dangerous.

65
00:04:58.964 --> 00:05:01.906
You don't wanna mess with that guy.

66
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.617
At the giant waterfall which had carved a
deep gorge in the jungle

67
00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:15.978
One of the few remaining families of mountain
gorillas lived in peace and harmony.

68
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
But even their secluded hideaway

69
00:05:19.125 --> 00:05:22.413
could not protect them
from the angry loner on the hunt for a family

70
00:05:22.715 --> 00:05:24.325
to take as his own.

71
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.811
And so the silverbacks had to fight.

72
00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:22.270
Look at all this volcanic activity.

73
00:07:22.515 --> 00:07:25.211
Wow! This wasn't here 2 days ago.

74
00:07:41.534 --> 00:07:43.695
There's some kind of magnetic interference.

75
00:07:47.607 --> 00:07:49.633
What is this place?

76
00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:06.683
Get us out of here!

77
00:08:06.759 --> 00:08:09.594
We're going to hit the wall!

78
00:08:09.595 --> 00:08:10.721
Pull her up!

79
00:08:10.797 --> 00:08:16.599
Come on... Come on!
Hold on, everyone!

80
00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:30.982
Oh, my God. Porter was right! Chris,
land the bird. I've got to check this out.

81
00:08:34.854 --> 00:08:36.754
I'll be back in an hour.

82
00:08:36.823 --> 00:08:38.924
One hour.

83
00:08:38.925 --> 00:08:40.893
It's getting late, okay?

84
00:08:41.994 --> 00:08:44.996
This place is - I don't
know, it's creepy.

85
00:08:44.997 --> 00:08:46.965
It's other-worldly, huh?

86
00:08:46.966 --> 00:08:48.831
Come on.

87
00:08:49.902 --> 00:08:52.962
Hey, Tarzan, Gigira, you're in charge.

88
00:08:53.039 --> 00:08:54.940
Say 'bye, Gigira.

88
00:08:54.941 --> 00:08:56.909
Bye-Bye.

89
00:09:04.884 --> 00:09:07.886
Gigira told me he had
a bad dream last night.

90
00:09:07.887 --> 00:09:10.989
Oh, no. Gigira, what did you dream?

91
00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:13.925
You left him behind in the jungle.

92
00:09:13.926 --> 00:09:17.953
Oh, silly Gigira, we would
never leave you behind.

93
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:19.998
Do you promise?

94
00:09:20.066 --> 00:09:21.124
I promise.

95
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:25.000
Alice... Alice, I found it.

96
00:09:25.071 --> 00:09:27.039
John? What is it?

97
00:09:27.106 --> 00:09:29.097
- A cave.
- A cave?

98
00:09:29.175 --> 00:09:32.008
- Are you going in there?
- I have to...

99
00:09:32.211 --> 00:09:34.179
I'll be back soon.

100
00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:39.150
And as John stepped into this most
inhospitable world cloaked in fog...

100
00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:45.249
the guardian monkeys protecting the meteor
for eons became more and more agitated.

101
00:09:49.195 --> 00:09:53.198
This secret which had been
dormant for millions of years...

102
00:09:53.199 --> 00:09:56.168
was about to be uncovered.

103
00:10:54.827 --> 00:10:59.730
John? Can you hear me?
Where are you?

104
00:11:00.866 --> 00:11:03.664
We really have to leave.

105
00:11:17.116 --> 00:11:19.084
The ground shook...

106
00:11:19.318 --> 00:11:22.685
And it seemed as though all
the elements were uniting.

107
00:11:23.122 --> 00:11:27.115
To avenge the wound that John
had cut into the meteor.

108
00:11:43.376 --> 00:11:45.537
- John... What happened?
- Dad! Dad!

109
00:11:45.611 --> 00:11:48.603
- Let's go!
- What happened?

110
00:12:12.824 --> 00:12:14.824
Hand him here.

111
00:12:33.759 --> 00:12:34.880
Something's pulling us down.

112
00:12:41.934 --> 00:12:45.700
And as the pilot battled
with the raging elements,

113
00:12:45.771 --> 00:12:48.831
another heart-rending
tragedy took place nearby.

114
00:12:48.974 --> 00:12:52.842
Which would have tremendous
consequences on things to come.

115
00:13:38.124 --> 00:13:41.025
You never should have ripped
that thing out of the rock.

116
00:14:02.081 --> 00:14:03.081
Did you see that?

117
00:14:13.259 --> 00:14:15.090
Forgive me.

118
00:14:28.217 --> 00:14:29.217
Mommy!

119
00:14:55.668 --> 00:14:59.604
The next morning, nature had calmed down.

120
00:15:00.606 --> 00:15:03.598
Kala, who had lost both husband and baby,

121
00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:06.569
wandered, heartbroken, through the jungle.

122
00:15:06.712 --> 00:15:09.510
When she came upon a strange object

123
00:15:09.615 --> 00:15:12.550
which had fallen from the
sky the night before.

124
00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:40.190
Mommy?

125
00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.548
Ohh.

126
00:16:13.779 --> 00:16:17.649
And Kala miraculously
gained a new child overnight,

127
00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:23.720
Tarzan found a caring hand to
protect him in the unforgiving wild.

128
00:16:55.624 --> 00:16:57.124
<i>Sneezing</i>

129
00:18:20.005 --> 00:18:23.975
Kara had decided to defend
her young by any means.

130
00:18:23.976 --> 00:18:25.710
But from the start, Tarzan had become

131
00:18:25.711 --> 00:18:28.780
a thorn in the side of Two-Blood,

132
00:18:28.781 --> 00:18:32.512
the new evil leader of the gorilla family.

133
00:18:41.026 --> 00:18:43.859
- Something's pulling us down!
- What's pulling us down?

134
00:19:22.039 --> 00:19:26.908
1, 2, 3... Ready or not, here I come!

135
00:19:27.111 --> 00:19:29.679
Not again.

136
00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:33.210
I know you're here somewhere.

137
00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.252
Got you!

138
00:19:47.064 --> 00:19:48.088
Wait for me!

139
00:19:53.437 --> 00:19:59.637
As time passed, the boy once known as J.J.
Greystoke, had all but ceased to exist.

140
00:20:00.043 --> 00:20:03.979
And in a world where the survival
of a young boy seemed impossible,

141
00:20:04.047 --> 00:20:06.072
he sensed a ray of hope.

142
00:20:06.216 --> 00:20:11.153
Now he really was Tarzan,
the ape without fur.

143
00:25:20.097 --> 00:25:25.131
Where are the gorillas?
This place blows!

144
00:25:40.117 --> 00:25:41.117
Derek!

145
00:25:41.184 --> 00:25:43.015
- Psycho!
- Bean pole!

146
00:25:43.086 --> 00:25:46.180
Seriously, dad, I don't know
how you do this every summer.

147
00:25:47.023 --> 00:25:49.048
They pay well.

148
00:25:49.126 --> 00:25:52.194
And, I guess you develop a few tricks.

149
00:25:54.097 --> 00:25:56.065
Whoopsies!

150
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:02.129
Smile, everybody!

151
00:26:15.185 --> 00:26:16.482
Well, here we are.

152
00:26:16.553 --> 00:26:19.420
Welcome to Camp Porter.

153
00:26:23.193 --> 00:26:25.423
The place is a dump!

154
00:26:30.534 --> 00:26:33.503
You got here just in time. The
gorillas are getting tired of my jokes.

155
00:26:34.237 --> 00:26:37.468
I've never seen stars like this.

156
00:26:37.607 --> 00:26:42.442
Just imagine, if you were a monkey,
you'd get to see this every night.

157
00:26:42.579 --> 00:26:46.515
Makes you wonder which primate
got the better deal, huh?

158
00:26:48.418 --> 00:26:53.549
Do you ever think about...
coming home, to New York?

159
00:26:53.657 --> 00:26:57.684
Maybe trying things again with Mom?

160
00:26:58.495 --> 00:27:02.522
I'm sorry, sweetheart, but This is my home.

161
00:27:02.599 --> 00:27:05.568
It always was.

162
00:27:06.603 --> 00:27:11.563
Well, in that case,
I have to come back.

163
00:27:11.708 --> 00:27:15.576
Jane, my darling, Nothing
would make me happier.

164
00:27:21.852 --> 00:27:25.621
Don't stay up too late, sweetheart.

165
00:27:25.622 --> 00:27:28.785
- We've got a big day tomorrow.
- Okay.

166
00:27:36.867 --> 00:27:39.700
Who's there?

167
00:27:45.008 --> 00:27:50.009
Oh, hey. I was just out
here looking for birds.

168
00:27:50.847 --> 00:27:52.948
Uh... I think I'm just
going to go this way.

169
00:27:52.949 --> 00:27:54.780
I think that's a good idea.

170
00:28:01.791 --> 00:28:03.782
Creep.

171
00:28:11.034 --> 00:28:14.003
Now remember, everyone, stay on the trail.

172
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:17.072
If you don't, we may never find you again.

173
00:28:17.073 --> 00:28:20.976
And more importantly, you
shouldn't make too much noise.

174
00:28:20.977 --> 00:28:24.003
Unless you want to end
up on someone's menu.

175
00:28:24.915 --> 00:28:26.940
Derek?

176
00:28:28.184 --> 00:28:31.950
Derek, where are you?

177
00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:50.060
Cool!

178
00:28:53.143 --> 00:28:55.008
Listen to me, Derek.

179
00:28:55.078 --> 00:28:56.670
This is very dangerous.

180
00:28:58.114 --> 00:29:02.414
You're going to walk
towards me very slowly.

181
00:29:02.485 --> 00:29:06.421
And whatever you do, don't run.

182
00:29:11.528 --> 00:29:13.393
Derek?

183
00:29:20.503 --> 00:29:22.403
Hey, hey ..

184
00:29:22.472 --> 00:29:25.441
Over here! Chase me!

185
00:29:25.442 --> 00:29:27.205
Oh, sh...

186
00:29:49.467 --> 00:29:52.026
Aah! It's okay. It's okay...

187
00:30:02.812 --> 00:30:04.746
Wow...

188
00:30:11.554 --> 00:30:13.545
Who's there?

189
00:30:16.026 --> 00:30:18.085
That's not good.

190
00:30:35.178 --> 00:30:38.113
Oh, come on...

191
00:30:42.285 --> 00:30:45.118
Oh, no!

192
00:31:07.047 --> 00:31:08.241
Jane!

193
00:32:02.332 --> 00:32:05.233
- Jane!
- Jane!

194
00:32:05.335 --> 00:32:08.099
Jane!

195
00:32:15.379 --> 00:32:18.280
Who are you?

196
00:32:49.517 --> 00:32:51.109
Jane?

197
00:32:51.386 --> 00:32:53.616
Jane!

198
00:32:54.089 --> 00:32:55.913
Oh, dad.

199
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:59.057
You're here.

200
00:33:00.095 --> 00:33:04.930
I'm not sure if he was a boy,
or some kind of ape.

201
00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:09.935
He ​​had these long arms
and massive shoulders.

202
00:33:10.004 --> 00:33:12.864
But the purest green eyes.

203
00:33:12.907 --> 00:33:16.968
- Should I be concerned?
- Dad! It's a jungle, not a pickup bar.

204
00:33:17.045 --> 00:33:18.112
Just asking.

205
00:33:18.113 --> 00:33:22.916
I'm fine, Dad. Really.
It may sound wierd, but...

206
00:33:22.917 --> 00:33:26.080
I've never felt safer in my life
.

207
00:33:26.988 --> 00:33:32.016
These were just the fantasies of a little
girl growing up before her dad's eyes.

208
00:33:32.093 --> 00:33:35.216
And she never dreamt that
what she encountered deep

209
00:33:35.228 --> 00:33:38.362
in the jungle was the young
Greystoke heir, himself.

210
00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:40.891
Bye.

211
00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:44.695
Jane...

212
00:33:51.047 --> 00:33:54.175
'It's ape language. It
means Ape with no fur.'

213
00:34:04.832 --> 00:34:06.332
Jane.

214
00:34:08.997 --> 00:34:11.761
Tarzan

215
00:34:13.001 --> 00:34:15.799
Tarzan...

216
00:35:46.427 --> 00:35:49.590
- 'We would never leave you behind'.
- 'You promise'?

217
00:36:19.727 --> 00:36:22.318
Yahhh!

218
00:36:47.855 --> 00:36:49.652
Ahh.

219
00:38:04.966 --> 00:38:07.958
His friends tried everything
to make him feel better.

220
00:38:08.302 --> 00:38:13.262
But nothing could fill the void
growing deep in Tarzan's heart.

221
00:39:59.714 --> 00:40:01.773
And while Jane flew back
home to her mother,

222
00:40:02.016 --> 00:40:06.043
Tarzan was tormented by a
thousand feelings and questions.

223
00:40:06.787 --> 00:40:12.783
His worls seemed to unravel as a longing
arose in him that he had never felt before.

224
00:40:25.909 --> 00:40:27.943
Years passed.

225
00:40:27.944 --> 00:40:29.912
Tarzan became stronger

226
00:40:30.046 --> 00:40:34.005
and reached father than any
other creature in the jungle.

227
00:42:11.114 --> 00:42:12.848
Mr. Clayton,

228
00:42:12.849 --> 00:42:14.950
Two hours ago our communications center

229
00:42:14.951 --> 00:42:17.886
received a signal from
one of our helicopters.

230
00:42:17.887 --> 00:42:19.854
So?

231
00:42:19.856 --> 00:42:21.948
It's Greystoke's.

232
00:42:22.892 --> 00:42:24.884
Greystoke's?

233
00:42:24.894 --> 00:42:25.918
After all these years...

234
00:42:26.462 --> 00:42:28.520
My God.

235
00:42:31.534 --> 00:42:33.602
- The board's ready for you, sir.
- Thanks, Amy.

236
00:42:33.603 --> 00:42:37.506
Mr. Clayton, If I could just
have a moment of your time.

237
00:42:37.507 --> 00:42:40.275
I'm with the Society for African Wildlife.

238
00:42:40.443 --> 00:42:42.377
- Huh, not again.
- Mr. Clayton.

239
00:42:42.445 --> 00:42:45.078
20 years ago John Greystoke
made a commitment to conservation.

240
00:42:45.114 --> 00:42:47.075
All we're asking is a small grant.

241
00:42:47.083 --> 00:42:50.013
Less than one percent of you annual profit.

242
00:42:50.019 --> 00:42:52.081
What did you say your name was?

243
00:42:52.155 --> 00:42:54.322
Jane. Jane Porter.

244
00:42:54.323 --> 00:42:55.950
I tell you what, Jane.

245
00:42:56.025 --> 00:42:59.023
Can you stick around?
I've got a board meeting now.

246
00:42:59.095 --> 00:43:00.992
Give me 30 minutes, okay?

247
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:04.127
- Great.
- Fine.

248
00:43:06.169 --> 00:43:09.070
70 million years ago,

249
00:43:09.405 --> 00:43:11.066
This planet was struck...

250
00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:13.335
bu an extraterrestrial object.

251
00:43:14.110 --> 00:43:16.476
But this was not just any meteor.

252
00:43:17.447 --> 00:43:19.381
This was something else.

253
00:43:20.149 --> 00:43:23.385
This was a new energy
source unlike anything

254
00:43:23.386 --> 00:43:24.410
we had ever seen.

255
00:43:24.487 --> 00:43:29.424
We believe that the meteor is buried
in a mantle of cooled lava.

256
00:43:29.492 --> 00:43:33.394
The technologial potential is limitless.

257
00:43:34.564 --> 00:43:37.362
This was the treasure

258
00:43:37.467 --> 00:43:40.493
that John Greystoke spent
his life attemptimg to find.

259
00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:42.571
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

260
00:43:42.572 --> 00:43:46.541
We should follow in the footsteps
of John Greystoke himself.

261
00:43:46.542 --> 00:43:49.511
And blaze new paths in energy production...

262
00:43:50.513 --> 00:43:51.605
at profits...

263
00:43:53.449 --> 00:43:55.517
he could never have dreamed of.

264
00:43:55.518 --> 00:43:57.509
I'm certain.

265
00:43:57.687 --> 00:44:00.622
That if we find Greystoke,
or what's left of him.

266
00:44:01.624 --> 00:44:04.081
We'll find that meteor.

267
00:44:04.093 --> 00:44:06.561
As you know, our competitors
are watching our every move.

268
00:44:06.629 --> 00:44:11.633
Now, we need a cover. Some way to get close
to the crash without anyone knowing...

269
00:44:11.634 --> 00:44:13.499
why we're there.

270
00:44:13.603 --> 00:44:15.127
I know a way.

271
00:44:15.705 --> 00:44:18.296
Ah, Jane, there you are.

272
00:44:19.575 --> 00:44:21.577
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
I'm so eager

273
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:23.602
to find out more about
your foundation.

274
00:44:24.814 --> 00:44:26.679
And how is your dad?

275
00:44:36.692 --> 00:44:39.787
Hey, I want to take a
closer look at that gorge.

276
00:45:23.539 --> 00:45:24.563
Hey!

277
00:45:28.744 --> 00:45:30.644
Darling!

278
00:45:31.647 --> 00:45:35.549
I swear you get more beautiful every year.

279
00:45:36.152 --> 00:45:38.120
It's so good to see you again, daddy.

280
00:45:40.056 --> 00:45:41.250
I missed you so much.

281
00:45:42.959 --> 00:45:45.060
Oh, and you must be Mr. Clayton.

282
00:45:45.061 --> 00:45:48.096
I can't tell you how much it
means to have your support.

283
00:45:48.097 --> 00:45:50.265
Oh, well, don't thank me. Thank Jane.

284
00:45:50.299 --> 00:45:52.626
She wouldn't take 'no' for an answer.

285
00:45:53.102 --> 00:45:55.663
Yes, and that's my associate, Mr. Smith.

286
00:45:56.439 --> 00:45:59.533
He's environmentally challenged.

287
00:46:02.345 --> 00:46:04.279
Well, I'm going to settle in.

288
00:46:04.347 --> 00:46:05.347
Okay, darling.

289
00:46:05.348 --> 00:46:07.306
Make yourself at home.

290
00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:10.352
So, this is your tent, and
watch out for the ants.

291
00:46:10.353 --> 00:46:12.353
- Ouch!
- Oh, and forgot to tell you, chitons bite.

292
00:46:22.732 --> 00:46:24.599
What with global warming,

293
00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:27.335
logging and regional conflict this
ecosystem has never been more threatened...

294
00:46:27.336 --> 00:46:29.437
I'll tell you, there's nothing

295
00:46:29.438 --> 00:46:35.399
more frustrating than standing around
helplessly while the jungle vanishes.

296
00:46:35.611 --> 00:46:37.476
What he's trying to say is,

297
00:46:37.647 --> 00:46:38.845
Thank you.

298
00:46:38.848 --> 00:46:39.940
Right, dad?

299
00:46:40.016 --> 00:46:41.779
Of course.

300
00:47:25.461 --> 00:47:27.326
Ow!

301
00:47:53.456 --> 00:47:54.936
Good night, everyone.
Good night, dad.

302
00:47:54.957 --> 00:47:56.788
Good night, sweetheart.

303
00:48:01.831 --> 00:48:03.958
I think I'd better turn in as well.

304
00:48:18.981 --> 00:48:20.972
Monkeys.

305
00:48:26.191 --> 00:48:28.191
Ahh...

306
00:48:28.324 --> 00:48:30.292
What do you want, Clayton?

307
00:48:32.328 --> 00:48:34.168
Excuse me?

308
00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:36.031
Well, ever since you took
over Greystoke Energies,

309
00:48:36.032 --> 00:48:37.090
you've ignored this place.

310
00:48:37.333 --> 00:48:40.786
And all of a sudden, after
what, 15 years, you decide to

311
00:48:40.798 --> 00:48:44.262
pop halfway across the earth
for an impromptu safari.

312
00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:46.032
Please!

313
00:48:46.075 --> 00:48:49.044
So, what do you want?

314
00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:53.971
The same thing that John Greystoke wanted.

315
00:48:54.417 --> 00:48:58.376
Have you ever considered there was
a reason why Greystoke perished?

316
00:48:58.487 --> 00:49:03.356
That perhaps there are some things
that are not meant to be discovered.

317
00:49:04.326 --> 00:49:07.352
Proter, you'd better start calming down.

318
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:08.897
You've hit the jackpot, havent you?

319
00:49:08.898 --> 00:49:12.067
Greystoke Energies is about
to start financing...

320
00:49:12.068 --> 00:49:14.602
your ridiculous research into
the cradle of civilization again.

321
00:49:14.603 --> 00:49:17.401
You'd better cooperate.

322
00:49:19.341 --> 00:49:23.368
That's a very pretty daughter
you've got there, Porter.

323
00:49:23.512 --> 00:49:27.414
You wouldn't want anyhing to
happen to her, now, would we?

324
00:49:45.734 --> 00:49:48.331
Who's there?

325
00:49:56.011 --> 00:49:58.037
Jane...

326
00:49:58.047 --> 00:49:59.105
You.

327
00:50:00.082 --> 00:50:02.182
You... you're real.

328
00:50:03.052 --> 00:50:06.021
All these years I wasn't
sure it actually happened.

329
00:50:06.155 --> 00:50:10.421
- Ah, these mosquitos!
- Wait, don't go!

330
00:50:13.362 --> 00:50:14.386
Wow.

331
00:50:30.513 --> 00:50:32.174
What are you doing?

332
00:50:33.549 --> 00:50:35.016
Don't sneak up on me like that.

333
00:50:35.151 --> 00:50:36.151
What is this?

334
00:50:37.853 --> 00:50:41.880
Oh, really, it's just for detecting
a highly radioactive meteor.

335
00:50:41.957 --> 00:50:43.754
A What?

336
00:50:43.859 --> 00:50:44.951
There you are!

337
00:50:45.895 --> 00:50:49.888
You lied to me, Clayton, you said
you want to support the foundation.

338
00:50:49.965 --> 00:50:51.990
You said there were no strings attached.

339
00:50:52.067 --> 00:50:54.030
Oh, Jane.

340
00:50:54.036 --> 00:50:56.905
Don't you know there are
always string attached.

341
00:50:56.906 --> 00:50:59.440
Isn't that right, Porter?

342
00:51:03.012 --> 00:51:04.877
Now I understand.

343
00:51:05.114 --> 00:51:07.947
God, how could I be such an idiot?

344
00:51:08.017 --> 00:51:10.918
You've been lying to me
the whole time, dad!

345
00:51:11.053 --> 00:51:14.022
Jane, wait! That's not true!

346
00:51:14.089 --> 00:51:15.920
Jane!

347
00:51:16.158 --> 00:51:19.027
- I hope you're happy.
- Relax!

348
00:51:19.028 --> 00:51:22.096
We all have to grow up sometime.

349
00:51:22.164 --> 00:51:24.064
Jane!

350
00:51:29.071 --> 00:51:30.368
Jane!

351
00:51:58.567 --> 00:52:01.468
Jane!

352
00:53:53.916 --> 00:53:56.043
Hey, uh...

353
00:54:05.994 --> 00:54:08.053
Oh no no no, thank you.

354
00:54:09.365 --> 00:54:11.094
No, don't, don't!

355
00:54:12.134 --> 00:54:13.134
Classy...

356
00:54:17.172 --> 00:54:18.366
You can talk.

357
00:54:22.111 --> 00:54:23.339
What is your name?

358
00:54:25.414 --> 00:54:28.110
- Name?
- Yes.

359
00:54:29.351 --> 00:54:30.375
Name.

360
00:54:30.486 --> 00:54:32.420
What is your name?

361
00:54:35.391 --> 00:54:38.383
Jane, my name is Jane.

362
00:54:42.498 --> 00:54:47.367
My name... Jane.

363
00:54:49.371 --> 00:54:54.468
No... My name is Jane.

364
00:54:55.511 --> 00:54:58.344
What is your name?

365
00:55:04.586 --> 00:55:07.521
- Tarzan.
- Tarzan?

366
00:55:08.524 --> 00:55:10.492
Tarzan.

367
00:55:11.493 --> 00:55:13.427
Jane.

368
00:55:13.662 --> 00:55:15.630
Me Tarzan ..

369
00:55:16.532 --> 00:55:19.592
- You Jane.
- Yes.

370
00:55:20.536 --> 00:55:23.704
Me Tarzan, you Jane.
Me Tarzan, you Jane.

371
00:55:23.705 --> 00:55:28.699
Me Tarzan, you Jane
Me tarzan, you Jane.

372
00:55:29.778 --> 00:55:32.611
Me Tarzan, you Jane.

373
00:55:33.816 --> 00:55:35.579
Jane.

374
00:55:42.408 --> 00:55:43.908
Wow.

375
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:50.925
- Jane, eat!
- Yes, Sir!

376
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:04.002
Whoever you are, whatever riddle's
buried inside you, Tarzan...

377
00:57:04.406 --> 00:57:08.408
I feel like I've always known you.

378
00:57:23.325 --> 00:57:24.917
Do you have a name?

379
00:57:25.127 --> 00:57:27.221
Rafiki.

380
00:57:27.329 --> 00:57:30.422
Watch over Tarzan when Tarzan sleep.

381
00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:39.998
For me?

382
00:57:41.410 --> 00:57:43.978
It's beautiful.

383
00:57:46.548 --> 00:57:49.581
Wow. My father has one just like it.

384
00:57:50.452 --> 00:57:52.476
Where did you find this?

385
00:57:58.728 --> 00:58:00.962
Smith, may I have the coordinates, please?

386
00:58:00.963 --> 00:58:02.826
It should be right here, sir.

387
00:58:02.832 --> 00:58:04.923
Jane?

388
00:58:06.802 --> 00:58:09.327
Oh my God, it's Jane!

389
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:17.804
Greystoke? No, that's impossible.

390
00:58:17.847 --> 00:58:19.873
What did you say?

391
00:58:20.349 --> 00:58:23.318
It is Jane. Some giant ape has her.

392
00:58:23.319 --> 00:58:25.887
No, no, don't shoot!

393
00:58:26.656 --> 00:58:28.390
You might hit Jane!

394
00:58:28.391 --> 00:58:29.585
Come on!

395
00:58:29.692 --> 00:58:32.788
No, no, don't shoot!

396
00:59:25.214 --> 00:59:28.742
On the run from Clayton, they entered a
strange world never before seen by man.

397
00:59:29.251 --> 00:59:33.239
A world which had been
under the influence of the

398
00:59:33.251 --> 00:59:37.251
meteor's mysterious energy
for millions of years.

399
00:59:47.370 --> 00:59:50.438
Uh... Thanks!

400
00:59:59.749 --> 01:00:01.341
Huh...

401
01:00:33.382 --> 01:00:35.247
Tarzan!

402
01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:45.284
Help!

403
01:00:50.399 --> 01:00:52.162
Jane...

404
01:01:33.709 --> 01:01:36.743
We'd better get out of here.

405
01:02:13.949 --> 01:02:15.746
Ah!

406
01:02:35.938 --> 01:02:37.462
Oh...

407
01:02:47.116 --> 01:02:48.913
Oh!

408
01:04:35.157 --> 01:04:40.184
This must be what my father and
Greystoke were looking for.

409
01:04:42.097 --> 01:04:44.065
Greystoke...

410
01:04:45.801 --> 01:04:48.869
you remember this place?

411
01:04:50.773 --> 01:04:53.741
Of course! You're the boy!

412
01:04:53.742 --> 01:04:55.573
You're Greystoke's son!

413
01:04:55.878 --> 01:05:00.076
But, how were you able to
survive all these years?

414
01:05:00.849 --> 01:05:02.917
My family told me.

415
01:05:02.918 --> 01:05:04.886
Your family?

416
01:06:03.045 --> 01:06:04.643
Hi.

417
01:06:07.649 --> 01:06:09.913
Oh, hi!

418
01:06:53.896 --> 01:06:57.627
Nice to meet you too.

419
01:07:38.207 --> 01:07:39.231
Tarzan!

420
01:07:45.247 --> 01:07:47.112
Tarzan!

421
01:08:20.415 --> 01:08:22.383
Tarzan! Don't!

422
01:08:24.653 --> 01:08:26.382
Oh, no!

423
01:08:57.686 --> 01:08:58.710
Help!

424
01:09:12.734 --> 01:09:13.734
Ah!

425
01:09:28.016 --> 01:09:29.916
Don't, Tarzan!

426
01:10:32.381 --> 01:10:33.913
Ah!

427
01:10:50.298 --> 01:10:53.631
Oh... Tarzan, I have to
go back to the camp.

428
01:10:53.969 --> 01:10:55.102
Jane...

429
01:10:55.103 --> 01:10:57.128
is angry with Tarzan?

430
01:10:57.205 --> 01:11:01.039
No, Tarzan! I'm not angry.

431
01:11:01.777 --> 01:11:04.779
But my father will not
rest until he finds me.

432
01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:08.808
And Clayton will kill you if he
finds out Greystoke's heir is alive.

433
01:11:08.984 --> 01:11:10.951
As long as I'm here...

434
01:11:10.952 --> 01:11:14.888
you and your family, and this
beautiful paradise are in danger.

435
01:11:14.956 --> 01:11:16.856
Tarzan strong!

436
01:11:17.059 --> 01:11:19.823
Tarzan king of the jungle.

437
01:11:19.895 --> 01:11:21.021
I know, Tarzan.

438
01:11:22.064 --> 01:11:25.565
But we can't fight Clayton's army.

439
01:12:03.071 --> 01:12:06.161
Bring it in! This way!

440
01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:08.886
Meanwhile, the camp had
undergone great changes.

441
01:12:08.898 --> 01:12:11.556
Keep going!

442
01:12:11.681 --> 01:12:16.930
As Clayton had made good on his threat
to find the meteor by any means.

443
01:12:27.796 --> 01:12:31.856
Hurry up, men. We don't have all night!

444
01:12:37.172 --> 01:12:39.672
I love you, Tarzan.

445
01:12:40.175 --> 01:12:42.738
And I always will.

446
01:12:46.114 --> 01:12:47.938
I have to go.

447
01:13:00.095 --> 01:13:01.662
Hey!

448
01:13:04.933 --> 01:13:07.724
Our little runaway has come back then, hey?

449
01:13:07.803 --> 01:13:10.830
Hello. What have we here?

450
01:13:14.009 --> 01:13:15.940
Ahh!

451
01:13:15.977 --> 01:13:18.044
Don't!

452
01:13:18.046 --> 01:13:22.639
Young Greystoke.Or do you
prefer king of the apes?

453
01:13:24.085 --> 01:13:26.619
The resemblance is uncanny.

454
01:13:27.055 --> 01:13:31.124
Although you have a ways to go in the
wardrobe department, don't you?

455
01:13:36.965 --> 01:13:39.090
You stay out of my way, savage.

456
01:13:39.134 --> 01:13:42.001
The only savage here is you, Clayton.

457
01:13:42.137 --> 01:13:46.904
Mr. Greystoke, would you be so kind
as to bring us to the meteor?

458
01:13:47.175 --> 01:13:48.175
Never.

459
01:13:49.010 --> 01:13:52.070
Then, unfortunately, we'll
have to go our separate ways.

460
01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:34.288
Tarzan!

461
01:14:34.289 --> 01:14:35.413
Take her to her father.

462
01:14:35.423 --> 01:14:37.514
Tarzan!

463
01:14:39.361 --> 01:14:40.919
Jane!

464
01:14:42.330 --> 01:14:44.395
Tarzan!

465
01:16:52.961 --> 01:16:58.900
Just think, the potential energy
stored in this one tiny piece...

466
01:16:58.967 --> 01:17:01.658
could power the entire
east coast for a month.

467
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:04.237
Think what we would do with a mountain!

468
01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:08.732
I'll tell you what -
you take me to the meteor,

469
01:17:09.677 --> 01:17:10.769
I'll set you both free.

470
01:17:10.946 --> 01:17:12.670
Like hell I will!

471
01:17:12.747 --> 01:17:14.271
Oh, Jane.

472
01:17:14.783 --> 01:17:18.318
Your time with the monkey man is
starting to rub off on you.

473
01:17:18.386 --> 01:17:21.177
Unfortunately, he's managed to escape.

474
01:17:21.289 --> 01:17:26.249
But Miller here, and his friends are
going to follow the trail of of your ape,

475
01:17:26.394 --> 01:17:29.261
who obviously means so much to you, Jane.

476
01:17:29.664 --> 01:17:33.361
And he is going to take care
of both him and his gang.

477
01:17:35.303 --> 01:17:37.368
I'll take you to the place.

478
01:17:38.173 --> 01:17:40.741
But you won't need to look for Tarzan.

479
01:17:41.009 --> 01:17:43.101
He'll find you!

480
01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:27.020
Look out! Incoming.

481
01:18:27.088 --> 01:18:29.147
My Grandma is quicker than you guys.

482
01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:42.362
Hook it up and let's get out of here.

483
01:19:16.304 --> 01:19:18.372
Detonation in ten minutes!

484
01:19:18.373 --> 01:19:20.238
Clear the blast zone!

485
01:19:30.185 --> 01:19:32.274
What the...?

486
01:19:41.196 --> 01:19:43.787
Detonation in eight minutes.

487
01:19:44.199 --> 01:19:46.093
I knew there was a meteor.

488
01:19:46.167 --> 01:19:47.334
Isn't it beautiful?

489
01:19:47.335 --> 01:19:50.065
Like a gigantic diamond.

490
01:19:50.138 --> 01:19:54.131
A mountain of unknown elements
from the depths of the universe.

491
01:19:54.209 --> 01:19:56.310
A gift from outer space.

492
01:19:56.311 --> 01:19:58.279
Dad, seriously?

493
01:19:58.346 --> 01:20:01.271
We'll be blown to pieces
in a few minutes.

494
01:20:01.316 --> 01:20:03.884
We'd better find a way to get out of here.

495
01:20:04.219 --> 01:20:07.752
Oh, of course. You're right, my love.

496
01:20:08.522 --> 01:20:12.526
Hello, love. I just want to say goodbye.

497
01:20:14.062 --> 01:20:15.128
Don't touch me!

498
01:20:15.129 --> 01:20:16.721
Ahh!

499
01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:27.831
Detonation in six minutes.

500
01:20:28.243 --> 01:20:30.310
Timing.

501
01:20:33.381 --> 01:20:36.445
Oh, You don't know how much I missed you.

502
01:20:37.151 --> 01:20:41.144
- Oh, ah, this is my dad.
- J.J.? I can't believe it's you.

503
01:20:41.222 --> 01:20:43.190
Look how big you've got!

504
01:20:43.291 --> 01:20:47.350
Boys, when we're done here,
can we please stop Clayton?

505
01:20:49.330 --> 01:20:51.161
Dad, come on!

506
01:20:51.299 --> 01:20:53.934
You go, and I'll stay
here and cut the cables.

507
01:20:53.935 --> 01:20:55.056
I'm not leaving without you.

508
01:20:55.103 --> 01:20:56.900
It's our only chance.

509
01:20:56.971 --> 01:20:57.995
Don't worry.

510
01:20:58.339 --> 01:21:01.372
Detonation in four minutes.

511
01:21:07.248 --> 01:21:08.272
Dad, hurry!

512
01:21:08.349 --> 01:21:10.249
I'll be there in a minute.

513
01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:21.288
Detonation in two minutes.

514
01:21:23.698 --> 01:21:25.793
- Are you ready?
- Yes, sir.

515
01:21:29.971 --> 01:21:31.569
Do it!

516
01:21:31.806 --> 01:21:33.338
No!

517
01:21:36.744 --> 01:21:38.276
What happened?

518
01:21:40.348 --> 01:21:42.879
You again! I should have known.

519
01:21:43.184 --> 01:21:45.242
What's next, jungle boy?

520
01:22:14.749 --> 01:22:16.776
Don't monkey with me.

521
01:22:41.743 --> 01:22:44.311
Oh, my God! Dad is still down there.

522
01:23:10.972 --> 01:23:14.070
Hurry! Come on!

523
01:23:20.748 --> 01:23:22.315
Go! Go!

524
01:23:30.691 --> 01:23:32.258
Stay on them!

525
01:23:41.736 --> 01:23:42.736
What's wrong?

526
01:23:42.737 --> 01:23:44.304
I don't know.

527
01:24:27.348 --> 01:24:28.712
Ah!

528
01:24:28.783 --> 01:24:32.375
Please! Don't let me go.

529
01:24:32.854 --> 01:24:34.412
Never.

530
01:24:50.771 --> 01:24:52.295
They're getting away!

531
01:25:34.715 --> 01:25:36.307
Let's go home, Tarzan.

532
01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:59.568
Now Tarzan watch over Jane forever.

533
01:26:59.705 --> 01:27:01.605
I know, Tarzan.

534
01:27:02.074 --> 01:27:05.143
And if anyone who threatens
this paradise again,

535
01:27:05.144 --> 01:27:07.512
they'll have to deal with us.

536
01:27:07.513 --> 01:27:09.208
Right, Rafiki?

537
01:27:21.661 --> 01:27:25.597
And as Tarzan, Jane and their friends
