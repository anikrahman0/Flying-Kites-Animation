00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Zootopia.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
A gleaming city.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Where animals of all breeds,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
predator and prey alike,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
live together in peace and harmony.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Hi!

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I'm Judy, your new neighbor!

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Yeah?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Well, we're loud.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Don't expect us to apologize for it.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
ZPD's

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
first rabbit officer,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Judy Hopps.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Ready to make the world a better place?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Bad news, in this city gripped by fear.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
What can you tell us about the animals that went savage?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Are we safe?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This is priority one.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Hopps.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Parking duty.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Sir, I'm not just some token bunny.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
You strike out, you resign.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Deal.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Hello?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I'm here to ask you some questions about a case.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Then they should have gotten a real cop to solve it.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
You're under arrest.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.000
For what?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Hooding a few winks?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
You, are a key witness.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.000
No.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
He is.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Hey!

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I need you to run a plate.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Alright, I know a guy.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
You need something done? He's on it.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
They're all ---

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
SLOTHS?!

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We're in a REALLY big hurry.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I am...

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
on...

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
It?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Break.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I have 36 hours left.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We can only solve it together.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
It's not about how badly you want something.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
It's about what you are capable of.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I am a real cop.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Never let them see that they get to you.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
You bunnies, so emotional.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
No no no! Do not let go!

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I'm gonna let go!

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
What?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
We may be evil.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
But deep down,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
we are still animals.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Quit it, you're gonna start a howl.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
No---! You are naked.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
For sure, we're a naturalist club.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
All the way down.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Oh...

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Life's a little bit messy.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
We all make mistakes!

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Ha.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Ha.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
No matter what type of animal you are,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
change starts with you.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
We gotta go.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Who's car is it?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The most feared crime boss

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Mr. Big!

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Is that Mr. Big?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Stop talking stop talking!

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Huh.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Ice them.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Whoa whoa whoa ah ah ah ah!

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Daddy---!

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Urgh!

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
What did we say!

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
No icing anyone at my wedding!

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I have to, baby.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Daddy has to.
